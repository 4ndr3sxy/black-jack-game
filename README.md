**Blackjack** (formerly **Black Jack** and **Vingt-Un**) is a [casino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino_game "Casino game")  [banking game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banking_game "Banking game"). The most widely played casino banking game in the world, it uses [decks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playing_card "Playing card") of 52 cards and descends from a global family of casino banking games known as [Twenty-One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-One_(card_game) "Twenty-One (card game)"). This family of [card games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_game "Card game") also includes the British game of [Pontoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontoon_(card_game) "Pontoon (card game)") and the European game, [Vingt-et-Un](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vingt-et-Un "Vingt-et-Un"). Blackjack players do not compete against each other. The game is a comparing card game where each player competes against the dealer.
